# üß† Complexity Classes

## üìò What Are Complexity Classes?
A **complexity class** is a group of computational problems that require **similar amounts of time or memory** for a computer to solve.  
They help computer scientists understand **how hard problems are** and **which algorithms are practical**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Resources We Measure
1. **Time complexity** ‚Üí how long an algorithm takes as input size grows  
2. **Space complexity** ‚Üí how much memory an algorithm uses  

We usually describe both using **Big-O notation** ‚Äî e.g., `O(n)`, `O(n¬≤)`, `O(2‚Åø)` ‚Äî to show how the work grows with the input size `n`.

## ‚è± Polynomial vs Exponential Time

| Term | Example | Growth | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Polynomial time** | `O(n)`, `O(n¬≤)`, `O(n¬≥)` | Grows reasonably | Efficient ‚Äî gets slower as inputs grow, but still practical |
| **Exponential time** | `O(2‚Åø)`, `O(3‚Åø)` | Grows extremely fast | Impractical ‚Äî becomes huge even for small inputs |

‚û°Ô∏è **Polynomial = good (feasible)**  
‚û°Ô∏è **Exponential = bad (explodes quickly)**

## üß© Key Complexity Classes

| Class | Meaning | Example Problems |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **P** | Problems that can be **solved quickly (in polynomial time)** | Sorting numbers, finding shortest paths (Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm) |
| **NP** | Problems where a **solution can be checked quickly**, even if finding it might be hard | Sudoku, Traveling Salesman, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) |
| **NP-complete** | The **hardest problems in NP** ‚Äî if one of them can be solved quickly, *all* NP problems can | Traveling Salesman, Subset Sum |
| **PSPACE** | Problems that can be solved using a **reasonable (polynomial) amount of memory** | Certain game-solving problems (like chess endgames) |
| **EXPTIME** | Problems that need **exponential time** | Solving generalized chess |

## üßÆ The Big Question: *P vs NP*
- **P** = problems that can be solved quickly.  
- **NP** = problems whose solutions can be *verified* quickly.  
- The **open question**:  
  > ‚ÄúIf a solution can be verified quickly, can it also be found quickly?‚Äù

This is the famous **P vs NP problem**, one of the biggest unsolved questions in computer science.  
No one knows yet if **P = NP** or **P ‚â† NP**.

## üß≠ In Summary
- **Complexity classes** categorize problems by how much **time** or **memory** they need.  
- **P** problems are efficient.  
- **NP** problems might not be.  
- **Exponential-time** problems blow up fast as input grows.  
- Understanding these classes helps us know **which problems are realistically solvable** by computers.
