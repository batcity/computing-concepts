# Character Encoding

Character encoding is a way to represent characters numerically. Characters can include letters, digits, symbols, or even emojis. However, not all character encoding standards support non-English characters, which is important for internationalization.

## Popular Character Encoding Standards

### ASCII
- **Size**: 7 bits → 2^7 = 128 characters  
- **Coverage**: Only supports English characters — not suitable for internationalization  
- **Types of characters**:
  - Printable: uppercase and lowercase English letters, digits, punctuation marks  
  - Control: 33 non-printable characters that manage device functions (e.g., carriage return, bell)  

**Example:**
- `'A'` → 65 (decimal)  
- `'a'` → 97 (decimal)  

### Unicode
