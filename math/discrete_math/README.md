# Discrete Mathematics:

Discrete mathematics is the study of Discrete structures

Discrete structures are mathematical models used to represent countable or "separated" things

Examples:

- Integers: **TODO** clarify why integers are considered discrete although they can go upto infinity

- Graphs: These have distinct nodes connected by distinct edges
